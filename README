CacaMap  is a Qt based  map browser widget that works with a bunch of tile servers.

How to use
----------

Just add cacaMap to your widget as a child.
If you need to draw anything on top of the map then create
another class that inherits from cacaMap. Implement the paintEvent,
and inside call cacaMap's paintEventHandler and then draw whatever 
you want.

void myDerivedMap::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *e)
{
	cacaMap::paintEvent(e);
	QPainter p(this);
	//you can draw here whatever you want
	//it will show up over the map
	p.drawSomething(...)
}
